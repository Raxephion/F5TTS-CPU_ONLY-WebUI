# E2/F5 TTS

This is a local web UI for F5 TTS with advanced batch processing support. This app supports the following TTS models:

* [F5-TTS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06885) (A Fairytaler that Fakes Fluent and Faithful Speech with Flow Matching)
* [E2 TTS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18009) (Embarrassingly Easy Fully Non-Autoregressive Zero-Shot TTS)

The checkpoints support English and Chinese.

If you're having issues, try converting your reference audio to WAV or MP3, clipping it to 15s, and shortening your prompt.

**NOTE: Reference text will be automatically transcribed with Whisper if not provided. For best results, keep your reference clips short (<15s). Ensure the audio is fully uploaded before generating.**
